Insert a search bar with AJAX search results anywhere you want with a shortcode

## Description

C.A.S.R. is a plugin that, through a shortcode — `[my-search-form]` —, inserts a search bar with AJAX results display anywhere on WordPress sites.

The plugin was developed with the performance needs of modern websites in mind, including Core Web Vitals; thus, its styles and scripts are loaded on the pages where they are actually needed.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin through [its page on the WordPress plugins directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-ajax-search-results/).
2. Upload the .zip file to your site and activate the plugin.
3. To customize the results display, go to `Settings > C.A.S.R.` in your admin panel.
